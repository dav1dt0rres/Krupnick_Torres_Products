Going in The point of view from which the passage is told can best be described as that of a: first person narrator describing the experience of picking strawberries as it happens.first person narrator describing events from the past that influenced her beliefs about gifts.third person narrator describing how each member of a family feels about gifts of nature.third person narrator describing a young girl’s thoughts about the importance of strawberries in her family’s celebrations. CS B THIS IS THE PASSAGE  Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
green. “Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn’t have.” After
fifty years they still raise the question of how to
respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a
silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.
But I know that someone else has wondered these
same things. In our Creation stories the origin of straw-
berries is important. Skywoman’s beautiful daughter,
whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving
birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
strawberry is ode min. the heart berry. We recognize
them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.
Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
you through no action of your own, free, having moved
toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and
mystery! as with random acts of kindness, we do not
know their source.
Those fields of my childhood showered us with
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.
I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
omy, “goods and services” not purchased but received

as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
this field.
In our family, the presents we gave one another
were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
definition of a gift: something you made for someone
else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
Clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
says it was because we had no money for store!bought
presents. It didn’t seem like a hardship to me; it was
something special.
My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father’s
Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
berry Shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.
In fact, he thought wild strawberry Shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.
Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
this! the strawberries showed us. Because they had 
given usa gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
Us.
Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall‘s farm to
pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
quart we picked.

Going in The main purpose of the second paragraph (lines 10-21) is to:explain why the narrator’s father encouraged his children to give strawberries as gifts.describe what the first strawberries looked like to the narrator’s ancestors.provide a cultural context for the significance of strawberries to the narrator's family.emphasize the importance of plants in traditional Potawatomi stories. CS C THIS IS THE PASSAGE     Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
green. “Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn’t have.” After
fifty years they still raise the question of how to
respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a
silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.
But I know that someone else has wondered these
same things. In our Creation stories the origin of straw-
berries is important. Skywoman’s beautiful daughter,
whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving
birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
strawberry is ode min. the heart berry. We recognize
them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.
Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
you through no action of your own, free, having moved
toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and
mystery! as with random acts of kindness, we do not
know their source.
Those fields of my childhood showered us with
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.
I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
omy, “goods and services” not purchased but received

as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
this field.
In our family, the presents we gave one another
were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
definition of a gift: something you made for someone
else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
Clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
says it was because we had no money for store!bought
presents. It didn’t seem like a hardship to me; it was
something special.
My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father’s
Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
berry Shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.
In fact, he thought wild strawberry Shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.
Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
this! the strawberries showed us. Because they had 
given usa gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
Us.
Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall‘s farm to
pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
quart we picked.                THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 3 ACT-Reading B04

Going in Based on the passage, which action was part of the narrator’s attempt to “give back to the strawberries” (lines 73-74)?She refrained from picking strawberries before they were ready.She weeded out patches of ground where the plants would take root.She made the strawberries into a gift for her father.She honored the legend of Skywoman by continuing to tell the story.

green. “Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn’t have.” After
fifty years they still raise the question of how to
respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a
silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.
But I know that someone else has wondered these
same things. In our Creation stories the origin of straw-
berries is important. Skywoman’s beautiful daughter,
whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving
birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
strawberry is ode min. the heart berry. We recognize
them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.
Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
you through no action of your own, free, having moved
toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and
mystery! as with random acts of kindness, we do not
know their source.
Those fields of my childhood showered us with
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.
I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
omy, “goods and services” not purchased but received

as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
this field.
In our family, the presents we gave one another
were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
definition of a gift: something you made for someone
else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
Clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
says it was because we had no money for store!bought
presents. It didn’t seem like a hardship to me; it was
something special.
My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father’s
Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
berry Shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.
In fact, he thought wild strawberry Shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.
Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
this! the strawberries showed us. Because they had 
given usa gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
Us.
Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall‘s farm to
pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
quart we picked.                 THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 5 ACT-Reading B04

Going in In the passage, the narrator states that as a child, she experienced her world as a:gift economy based on gifts from the earth.wage economy in which her family struggled.playground she visited on rare but wonderful occasions.classroom filled with friends and neighbors. KID A THIS IS THE PASSAGE   Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
green. “Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn’t have.” After
fifty years they still raise the question of how to
respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like a
silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.
But I know that someone else has wondered these
same things. In our Creation stories the origin of straw-
berries is important. Skywoman’s beautiful daughter,
whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving
birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
strawberry is ode min. the heart berry. We recognize
them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.
Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
you through no action of your own, free, having moved
toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and
mystery! as with random acts of kindness, we do not
know their source.
Those fields of my childhood showered us with
strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.
I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
omy, “goods and services” not purchased but received

as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
this field.
In our family, the presents we gave one another
were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
definition of a gift: something you made for someone
else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
Clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
says it was because we had no money for store!bought
presents. It didn’t seem like a hardship to me; it was
something special.
My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father’s
Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
berry Shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.
In fact, he thought wild strawberry Shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.
Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
this! the strawberries showed us. Because they had 
given usa gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
Us.
Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall‘s farm to
pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
quart we picked.

Going in According to the passage, picking the strawberries for their father’s Shortcake took the narrator and her sib" lings a long time because:they kept eating the strawberries they picked.the strawberry patches had many bugs.their father expected only the ripest strawberries.they could gather the strawberries only on Saturdays.

poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
tioned the extra protein.
In fact, he thought wild strawberry Shortcake was
the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
was a gift that could never be bought. As children
raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.
Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
this! the strawberries showed us. Because they had 
given usa gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
Us.
Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall‘s farm to
pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
quart we picked.

Going in Which of the following details from the passage best supports the author's claim about the impact of paradigms on success?Illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage were first published in the early 1840s.The Wrights’ knowledge of bicycles made banking an airplane seem natural to them.Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first to achieve heavier-than-air flight in Europe.The first automobile was a European invention. IKI B THIS IS THE PASSAGE The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind"sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can place blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.
Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri!
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe’s many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloons in l783"might
well have been first. If so. the airplane. like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.
What led Europe’s aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson’s persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.
First published in the early 18405, the engraved
illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than a half century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe’s
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.
The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did in
horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France’s early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.
Part of Henson’s paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don’t tilt sideways. or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.
Henson’s vision told Europe’s early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe’s pioneers were terrified of banking, or drop!
ping a wing in flight.

Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
riage paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.
Consequently, Europe’s “early birds” were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply “drive" it around
the sky.
A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe’s first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His l4-bis was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to
actually land where he had taken off.
Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson’s artwork, but it didn’t
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
. manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.
Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What’s more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he’s in 
for a spill.

Going in The main idea of the fourth paragraph (21-30) is that Henson's illustrationswere so popular that they appeared in newspapers and magazines for over half a century.encouraged experimenters to imagine even more thrilling airplane designs than Henson had.inspired experimenters and helped them build the • first working airplanes more quickly.D.	motivated experimenters but hindered their ability to invent a successful airplane. KID D THIS IS THE PASSAGE   The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind"sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can place blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.
Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri!
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe’s many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloons in l783"might
well have been first. If so. the airplane. like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.
What led Europe’s aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson’s persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.
First published in the early 18405, the engraved
illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than a half century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe’s
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.
The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did in
horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France’s early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.
Part of Henson’s paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don’t tilt sideways. or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.
Henson’s vision told Europe’s early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe’s pioneers were terrified of banking, or drop!
ping a wing in flight.

Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
riage paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.
Consequently, Europe’s “early birds” were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply “drive" it around
the sky.
A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe’s first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His l4-bis was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to
actually land where he had taken off.
Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson’s artwork, but it didn’t
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
. manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.
Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What’s more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he’s in 
for a spill.                 THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 13 ACT-Reading B04

Going in According to the passage, compared to Europe's early experimenters, the Wrights were less inspired by Henson's vision because they were:determined not to copy other designers' work.unaware of Henson's work with hot-air balloons.accustomed to a different mode of transportation.more inspired by Santos-Dumont's vision. KID C THIS IS THE PASSAGE    The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind"sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can place blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.
Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri!
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe’s many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloons in l783"might
well have been first. If so. the airplane. like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.
What led Europe’s aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson’s persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.
First published in the early 18405, the engraved
illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than a half century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe’s
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.
The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did in
horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France’s early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.
Part of Henson’s paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don’t tilt sideways. or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.
Henson’s vision told Europe’s early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe’s pioneers were terrified of banking, or drop!
ping a wing in flight.

Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
riage paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.
Consequently, Europe’s “early birds” were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply “drive" it around
the sky.
A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe’s first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His l4-bis was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to
actually land where he had taken off.
Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson’s artwork, but it didn’t
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
. manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.
Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What’s more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he’s in 
for a spill.                   THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 16 ACT-Reading B04

aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.
The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did in
horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France’s early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.
Part of Henson’s paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don’t tilt sideways. or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.
Henson’s vision told Europe’s early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe’s pioneers were terrified of banking, or drop!
ping a wing in flight.

Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
riage paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.
Consequently, Europe’s “early birds” were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply “drive" it around
the sky.
A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe’s first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His l4-bis was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to
actually land where he had taken off.
Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson’s artwork, but it didn’t
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
. manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.
Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What’s more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he’s in 
for a spill.                THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 18 ACT-Reading B04

Going in As it is used in line 19, the word sway most nearly means:fluctuation.influence.regime.grace. CS B THIS IS THE PASSAGE The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind"sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can place blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.
Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri!
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe’s many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers’ hot-air balloons in l783"might
well have been first. If so. the airplane. like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.
What led Europe’s aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson’s persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.
First published in the early 18405, the engraved
illustrations of the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than a half century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe’s
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect

Going in In Passage A, the phrase “smoothly blended playing" (line 5) most nearly describes:the quality that Ellington elicited from a group of dissimilar musicians.a sound that band leaders Goodman, Shaw, and Lunceford demanded from their musicians.a sound that Shaw achieved more successfully than did Lunceford and Goodman.a specific goal Ellington set for his band but found hard to achieve. KID B THIS IS THE PASSAGE  What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
“accumulation of personalities” was a loose. festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman’s band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds asa pointillist painter might place dots of
red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations (“With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create”). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did
like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, “My ear makes
my decision.” To him, no other ear mattered.
Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington’s working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: “Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect.” Sometimes he worked “on” his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet “on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
“to mold the music around the man,” and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
It.

Passage B by Greg Kot

In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice. and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became achore, he turned to his family.
“One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn’t show up for rehearsal.”
Mavis says. “He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn’t have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."
Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.
“People always ask, ‘How do we get the sound we
have?’ And that came from my father"the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, ‘Now, Mavis go here,’
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was ‘Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.’”

Going in (Passage A) One of the main ideas of the second paragraph of Pas" sage A (lines 30!48) is that in the process of achieving the sound hewanted from his band, Ellington:accepted that the individual excellence of the players might occassionaly be sacrificed.elicited from his players performances that tapped their particular musical gifts.invited each musician to articulate performance goals that he then helped them reach.maintained a strict rehearsal schedule that some of the musicians rebelled against. KID B THIS IS THE PASSAGE What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
“accumulation of personalities” was a loose. festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman’s band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds asa pointillist painter might place dots of
red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations (“With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create”). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did
like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, “My ear makes
my decision.” To him, no other ear mattered.
Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington’s working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: “Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect.” Sometimes he worked “on” his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet “on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
“to mold the music around the man,” and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
It.

Passage B by Greg Kot

In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice. and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became achore, he turned to his family.
“One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn’t show up for rehearsal.”
Mavis says. “He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn’t have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."
Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.
“People always ask, ‘How do we get the sound we
have?’ And that came from my father"the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, ‘Now, Mavis go here,’
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was ‘Will the

Going in Which of the following statements about Pops’s child" hood is best supported by Passage B?He grew up in Mississippi With brothers and sis" ters who liked to sing together.He started the Trumpet Jubilees with his siblings but quit by the time he was a teenager.His musical career started in a small apartment where he taught himself to play guitar.With his brothers, he was part of a singing group that gained Michael Jackson’s admiration. KID A THIS IS THE PASSAGE  What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
“accumulation of personalities” was a loose. festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman’s band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds asa pointillist painter might place dots of
red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations (“With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create”). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did
like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, “My ear makes
my decision.” To him, no other ear mattered.
Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington’s working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: “Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect.” Sometimes he worked “on” his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet “on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
“to mold the music around the man,” and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
It.

Passage B by Greg Kot

In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice. and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became achore, he turned to his family.
“One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn’t show up for rehearsal.”
Mavis says. “He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn’t have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."
Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.
“People always ask, ‘How do we get the sound we
have?’ And that came from my father"the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, ‘Now, Mavis go here,’
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was ‘Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.’”

Going in (Both) Which of the following comparisons between one of the musicians mentioned in Passage A and Pops is best supported by the passages?Like Hibbler, Pops was hired to join an established jazz band.Like Ellington, Pops is compared to a painter putting different colors side by side on a canvas.Like Strayhorn, Pops had a mentor he turned to throughout his life.Like Goodman, Pops valued a sound that was precise. IKI D THIS IS THE PASSAGE  What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
“accumulation of personalities” was a loose. festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman’s band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds asa pointillist painter might place dots of
red and green side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations (“With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create”). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. “I never did
like anything Ellington ever did,” he said. “He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend.” What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an unconventional
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, “My ear makes
my decision.” To him, no other ear mattered.
Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington’s working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: “Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect.” Sometimes he worked “on” his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet “on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
“to mold the music around the man,” and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
It.

Passage B by Greg Kot

In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice. and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became achore, he turned to his family.
“One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn’t show up for rehearsal.”
Mavis says. “He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn’t have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."
Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.
“People always ask, ‘How do we get the sound we
have?’ And that came from my father"the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, ‘Now, Mavis go here,’
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was ‘Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.’”

Going in The main idea of the passage is that the Messel Pit is significant primarily because it:substantiates the theory that mammals appeared 200 million years ago.features fossils of mammals and dinosaurs interacting.contains fossils that reveal how warm-blooded animals evolved.has fossils of dinosaurs that have not been found elsewhere. KID C THIS IS THE PASSAGE At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.
Still, that alone doesn’t explain why so many land
mammals"not to mention birds, bats and insects"per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.
The lake was so deep that oxygen didn’t circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and the algae and other
organic matter turned into oil shale.
Among the thousands of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. “They just
tried to stay out of the way,” says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.
Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. “They really tried every-
thing"flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating,” says Lehmann. “From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us.”

Might have, but in many cases didn‘t. Messel’s
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly
familiar. In the visitor center. kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of Ailuravus macrurus looks like that of a
giant squirrel. lt’s three feet long. including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature’s fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no
squirrel ancestor. It’s an evolutionary dead end;
Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.
Ailuravus’ resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions"bushy tails, say. or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs"popping up in different species. “It’s like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms," says Lehmann.
And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies"some successful, others not"adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-
tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse’s stomach"fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.

Going in In the passage, Ailuravus macrurus most nearly serves as an example of a species that:evolved into a modern-day animal, despite compe­ tition from similar animals.adapted to its environment in ways scientists hadn't seen previously.developed physical traits that its modern-day descendants did not inherit.left no descendants, despite its apparent resem­ blance to modern-day animals. CS D THIS IS THE PASSAGE  At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.
Still, that alone doesn’t explain why so many land
mammals"not to mention birds, bats and insects"per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.
The lake was so deep that oxygen didn’t circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and the algae and other
organic matter turned into oil shale.
Among the thousands of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. “They just
tried to stay out of the way,” says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.
Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. “They really tried every-
thing"flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating,” says Lehmann. “From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us.”

Might have, but in many cases didn‘t. Messel’s
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly
familiar. In the visitor center. kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of Ailuravus macrurus looks like that of a
giant squirrel. lt’s three feet long. including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature’s fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no
squirrel ancestor. It’s an evolutionary dead end;
Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.
Ailuravus’ resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions"bushy tails, say. or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs"popping up in different species. “It’s like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms," says Lehmann.
And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies"some successful, others not"adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-
tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse’s stomach"fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.                  THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 34 ACT-Reading B04

Going in Based on the passage, which of the following scenarios most nearly represents an example of evolutionary convergence?Several species of birds each evolving a different beak to take advantage of new food sourcesOne bird species becoming extinct because of competition from a similar speciesDistinct species of birds developing wings that are nearly identical in structureMany bird species moving to the same region because of food scarcity KID C THIS IS THE PASSAGE  At some point around 50 million years ago, under-

Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.
Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. “They really tried every-
thing"flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-

evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what

giant squirrel. lt’s three feet long. including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature’s fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no
squirrel ancestor. It’s an evolutionary dead end;
Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.
Ailuravus’ resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough

tions"bushy tails, say. or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs"popping up in different species. “It’s like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different

horse’s stomach"fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to

Going in It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that fewer fossils would have been preserved in the Messel Pit if the lake they were in had contained :oxygen circulating near the bottom.layers of clay on the bottom.abundant algae on the surface.carbon dioxide that rose to the surface. KID A THIS IS THE PASSAGE   At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.
Still, that alone doesn’t explain why so many land
mammals"not to mention birds, bats and insects"per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.
The lake was so deep that oxygen didn’t circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and the algae and other
organic matter turned into oil shale.
Among the thousands of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. “They just
tried to stay out of the way,” says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.
Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million

ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of

Going in According to the. passage, by examining the contents of a prehistoric horse's stomach, paleontologists deter­ mined that the horse ate:more grass than modern horses eat.many plants that modern horses eat.food from the ground of forests.food from a prehistoric open plain. KID C THIS IS THE PASSAGE     At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.
Still, that alone doesn’t explain why so many land
mammals"not to mention birds, bats and insects"per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.
The lake was so deep that oxygen didn’t circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and the algae and other
organic matter turned into oil shale.
Among the thousands of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. “They just
tried to stay out of the way,” says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.
Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. “They really tried every-
thing"flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating,” says Lehmann. “From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us.”

Might have, but in many cases didn‘t. Messel’s
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly
familiar. In the visitor center. kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of Ailuravus macrurus looks like that of a
giant squirrel. lt’s three feet long. including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature’s fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no
squirrel ancestor. It’s an evolutionary dead end;
Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.
Ailuravus’ resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions"bushy tails, say. or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs"popping up in different species. “It’s like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms," says Lehmann.
And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies"some successful, others not"adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-
tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse’s stomach"fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.                  THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 39 ACT-Reading B04

Going in Based on the passage, which of the following pieces of evidence supports the conclusion that prehistoric horses had adopted herd behavior?Specimens of pregnant mares were found near fossils of young foals.Eight fossils of mares were found with the same kinds of plants in their digestive tracts.Fossils of mare hoofprints that all pointed in the same direction were found.Fossils of pregnant mares that each carried a single foal were found.

Going in Their instruments of choice *is considered* [1] rather unusual: a pan pipe fashioned from carrots, an ocarina created from a sweet potato, other brightly colored vegetables.no changedoes seemareis agreement singular and plural 3 and 1 C THIS IS THE PASSAGE [1]
Though they can often be seen lugging bags stuffed with fresh vegetables home from Beijing markets, brothers Nan Weidong and Nan Weiping are not chefs- they are musicians. [A] Their instruments of choice *is considered* [1] rather unusual: a pan pipe fashioned from carrots, an ocarina created from a sweet potato, *other brightly colored vegetables.* [2] Gourds, daikon radishes, and *other vegetables, are used* [3] to round out the "orchestra."

[2]
From an early age, the Nan brothers, raised on a vegetable farm in China's  Anhui province,  *who were* [4] taught to play conventional musical instruments by their father, a music  teacher. [B] The siblings'  love of music and passion for performance led them to begin experimenting with vegetable musical instruments a few years ago.

[3]
*Working by hand while constructing* [5] their edible instruments, the brothers manually bore holes into the vegetables by using long metal drill bits, snacking on discarded pieces as they work. [C) Weiping says that to create a low pitch, *which makes* [6] a deep hole. *Nonetheless,* [7] a high pitch requires a shallow hole.  Other *factors, like,* [9] the diameter of the hole and changes in air temperature and humidity, also *effects* [9] the sound quality. 

[4]
[ 1]   A newly  picked  vegetable  that sits at the market for even one day may lose much of its water content, *producing* [10] a pitch that is out of tune.  [2] Because of this, the brothers must carve a fresh set of instruments before each performance. [3] Still, the most critical ingredient in creating high-quality *sound, Weidong says,* [11] is the vegetables' high water content. 

[5]
*While the brothers' musical repertoire is* [13] as varied
as their instruments, ranging  from  traditional  Chinese flute music to modern pop songs. [D] They maintain that different vegetables have different scales and are therefore suited to different types of music. Since 2011, the Nan brothers have performed regularly, playing a wide variety of music on their edible instruments and bringing a whole new meaning to the idea of playing with your food.

Going in 14.	At this point, the writer is considering adding the fol­ lowing true statement:    Each pitch is tested and perfected with the help of an old electronic tuner.    Should the writer make this addition here?Yes, because it supports the idea that the brothers exercise care and attention to detail as they craft their vegetable instruments.Yes, because it helps explain  how  vegetables can be turned into a precise musical instrument .No, because it provides information about the process of creating instruments that is not relevant at this point in the essay.No, because it conflicts with the idea that the brothers have a strong musical background. cat 3 yes/no C THIS IS THE PASSAGE [1]

Vivarium comes from the Latin word vivus, which means "alive"-a fitting description for a piece of art that exemplifies a thriving forest ecosystem. [B] Dion found the log part of a western hemlock *lying in* [19] a Washington forest, *and transporting* [20] to the city along with some of the soil, fungi, and plants that had surrounded the tree. [C] Working with a team of scientists and architects, Dion installed the log in a specially constructed eighty-foot-long greenhouse.

[D] Humidity is electronically monitored, the soil is *constantly replenished with nutrients;* [24] and sunlight is filtered through green-hued glass designed to mimic the color of a forest canopy. [25]

For Dion, the amount of work *in the middle of a busy city* [26] required to sustain this ecosystem conveys an important message. *According with* [27] the artist, the constant effort substitutes for what nature does instinctively, which highlights the fact that “it’s incredibly difficult, expensive, and technological to approximate that system.” In other words, nature, once *destroyed is virtually* [28] impossible to reconstruct.

Going in The writer is considering adding the following paren­ thetical information to the essay:    (The Neukom in the installation's title refers to the name of the work's patrons.)    If the writer were to add this sentence, it would most logically be placed at:Point A in Paragraph 1Point B in Paragraph 2Point C in Paragraph 2Point D in Paragraph 3 cat 3 sequence B THIS IS THE PASSAGE       Located in Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, artist Mark Dion’s Neukom Vivarium has been called a combination of art and ecology, sculpture and nature. The installation contains a sixty-foot-long nurse log, *it is* [16] a slowly decaying piece of tree trunk that provides a home and nutrients for young plants and supports a variety of microbial life. [A] This single *log offers visitors* [17] to the urban *park, a glimpse into the complicated cycle of life* [18] unfolding in the forests outside the city. 

[2]
Vivarium comes from the Latin word vivus, which means "alive"-a fitting description for a piece of art that exemplifies a thriving forest ecosystem. [B] Dion found the log part of a western hemlock *lying in* [19] a Washington forest, *and transporting* [20] to the city along with some of the soil, fungi, and plants that had surrounded the tree. [C] Working with a team of scientists and architects, Dion installed the log in a specially constructed eighty-foot-long greenhouse. The greenhouse is customized with magnifying glasses and microscopes that disclose minute details of the life supported by the *log. Repeated* [21] visits to the installation *reveals* [22] the larger process of decay and transformation.

[3]
In the wild, this complex, interconnected system of life would have had no trouble sustaining itself. In the city, however, maintaining the nurse log requires *a great number of* [23] energy and technology. [D] Humidity is electronically monitored, the soil is *constantly replenished with nutrients;* [24] and sunlight is filtered through green-hued glass designed to mimic the color of a forest canopy. [25] 

[4]
For Dion, the amount of work *in the middle of a busy city* [26] required to sustain this ecosystem conveys an important message. *According with* [27] the artist, the constant effort substitutes for what nature does instinctively, which highlights the fact that “it’s incredibly difficult, expensive, and technological to approximate that system.” In other words, nature, once *destroyed is virtually* [28] impossible to reconstruct.

Going in 30.	Suppose the writer 's primary purpose had been to describe how one artist uses a work of art to educate people about an issue the artist feels is important. Would this essay accomplish that purpose?Yes, because it describes how Dion saw that local forests were being destroyed and then decided to make a sculpture out of a fallen tree.Yes, because it describes Dion's nature -based installation and explains the message Dion hopes to convey through Neukom VivariumNo, because it focuses on what Dion's installation looks like and how it contributes to the Olympic Sculpture Park.No, because it fails to indicat e what Neukom Vivarium's viewers actually learn from the installation. cat 3 yes/no B THIS IS THE PASSAGE       Located in Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, artist Mark Dion’s Neukom Vivarium has been called a combination of art and ecology, sculpture and nature.

Going in Given that all the choices are true, which one best con­cludes the essay by using specific information to com­plete the contrast begun in the previous sentence?no changeMosaic's point-and-click interface revolutionized the way people used the Internet.Andreessen would go on to develop another highly successful web browserSince then, the web has expanded at an exponen­tial rate. cat 2 location A THIS IS THE PASSAGE   Before Mosaic-the web browser widely credited with
popularizing the World Wide Web-was invented, the 
Internet wasn’t user-friendly. Internet *navigation required* [31] 
knowledge of specific typed commands; online documents,
consisting almost entirely of text, were hard to locate and
download. *Given these obstructive hindrances,* [32] many
people assumed the web would remain the domain of
technology experts and never have mass appeal. Marc
Andreessen believed the *opposite,* [33] everyone would
want the Internet. [34]

As a student *worker, for the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications, (NCSA)* [35] at the University
of Illinois, Andreessen *became enthralled by* [36] the Internet.
In 1992, he conceived of a browser that would simplify web
navigation. Rather than typing specific commands, people
would be able to access different web pages by clicking on
icons. He showed his idea to fellow student Eric Bina, who
helped refine the program. The two
then worked with the NCSA to develop Mosaic,
*which became* [37] available in 1993. Free to anyone with
an Internet connection, Mosaic quickly became popular.
*Approximately 60,000 copies of the browser* [38] were 
downloaded in its first year.

	Mosaic was *soon* [39] not the first web browser, but 
It surpassed all rivals. Unlike other browsers, Mosaic 
was easy to install, and it worked on every operating 
system. It was the first browser to display pictures 
and text on the same page. [40] Featuring hyperlinks, 
*the user of the program was able* [41] to visit other web 
pages with one click. “With Mosaic,” said one writer, 
“the online world appears to be a vast, interconnected 
universe of information.” [42] 

	Even though it gave way to other, more 
sophisticated browsers within a few years, Mosaic 
showed average users the significance of the Internet. 
*Comparatively,* [43] its simplicity encouraged people to 
create and upload their own content. In the year 
Mosaic was *discharged,* [44] 623 websites existed.  
*Four years later, there were more than 600,000.* [45]                 THIS IS THE QUESTION NUMBER 45 ACT-English A11

Going in Which choice most clearly emphasizes the overwhelm­ingly positive reception great poets enjoyed during athletic festivals in ancient Greece?no changecelebratedacceptedliked keyword cat 2 B THIS IS THE PASSAGE [1]
During athletic festivals in ancient Greece, great poets were *placed* [46] alongside champion athletes. This has never been true of the modern Olympic Games. [A] The Olympic literary competition, reintroduced in 1912 in Stockholm and included in the Games for decades,
*is poorly remembered and rarely missed.* [47] The only genuine public excitement for even the *very first modern, Olympic* [48] literary contest was focused on the scandal surrounding the winning poem. [B]

[2]
French aristocrat Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who
in 1896 founded the modern Olympic Games, *he insisted* [49] that talent in the fine arts was as  important as skill  in  athletics. After years of opposition from officials *whom* [50] felt that the modern Games should focus solely on athletics, Coubertin implemented fine arts competitions, known as the Pentathlon of Muses, in 1912. [C] For the literary contest, *it* [51] would submit an unpublished *work; Coubertin did not establish a length requirement.* [52] After a long deliberation during the literary event's first *year; finally judges* [53] named duo George Hohrod and Martin Eschbach as gold medalists for their poem "Ode to Sport."
[3]
The *judges,* [54] so impressed by "Ode to Sport" that they called it "the perfect poem," refused to award either silver or bronze medals to any other literary competitors. *Weeks, after the Games had come to an end,* [55] the judges attempted to contact Hohrod and Eschbach given that the two had not come forward to receive their medals. *The judges discovered that neither author existed.* [56] A few years later, Coubertin admitted that he himself had submitted “the perfect poem” pseydonymously. [57]



[4]
The judges argued that they did not know that Coubertin had written “Ode to Sport.” But once Coubertin’s ruse was uncovered , distrust for the already unpopular competition *expanded as a result- and* [58]  the feeling endured. [D] The literary competition was dropped after the 1948 London Games. Many of the winning poems have since vanished, with only their titles remaining. Few literary historians think that much has been lost.

magnificent glaciers. *Soon her interest in the region

*close* [68] south of the North Pole. Botanists gathered
plant specimens from the *tundra--* [69] paleogeologists
studied the ancient ice fields, and hydrogeographers searched
for mountains on the ocean floor.

a tripod-mounted large-format camera that *freed* [70] crisp,

Going in Suppose the writer's primary purpose had been to explain the way Boyd's photographs were used to make maps of the east coast of Greenland. Would this essay accomplish that purpose?Yes, because the writer hints that because  Boyd had studied photogrammetry, she deliberately cre­ated photographs that could be used to make maps.Yes, because the writer makes clear that Boyd had photographed a region that, before her expeditions, had not been thoroughly documented.No, because although the writer mentions that Boyd's photographs were used to make maps, the writer does not elaborate on how this was done.No, because the writer instead focuses on describ­ ing how Boyd positioned her camera to create high-resolution images of glaciers. cat 3 yes/no C THIS IS THE PASSAGE   San Francisco *native, Louise Arner Boyd,* [61]
